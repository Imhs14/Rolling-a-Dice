# 🎲 Rolling a Dice Simulator

A lightweight Python script that simulates the rolling of a six-sided die. This project is perfect for beginners looking to understand loops, user input, and the `random` module in Python.

## 📝 Project Description

This simulator mimics the experience of throwing a die. It generates a random number between 1 and 6 and displays it to the user. The program allows the user to keep rolling the die as many times as they want without having to restart the script.

## 🚀 Features

* **Randomized Results**: Uses the `random` module to ensure a fair and unpredictable outcome every time.
* **Looping Gameplay**: Includes a "roll again" feature so you can play continuously.
* **Simple Logic**: Easy-to-understand code structure, making it a great learning resource.
* **Error Handling**: (Optional - *if included*) Manages invalid user inputs gracefully.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

## 💻 Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Imhs14/Rolling-a-Dice.git

```


2. **Navigate to the directory**:
```bash
cd Rolling-a-Dice

```


3. **Run the script**:
```bash
python main.py

```


*(Note: If your file is named something else, like `dice_roll.py`, use that name instead of `main.py`.)*

## 🎮 How it Works

1. When you run the script, it will "roll" the die.
2. A random number from **1 to 6** will be displayed.
3. The program will ask if you want to roll again (e.g., "Enter 'y' to roll again or 'n' to exit").
